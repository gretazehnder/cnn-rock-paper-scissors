# Rock–Paper–Scissors Image Classification with CNNs

## Project Overview

This project investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a multi-class image classification task based on the Rock–Paper–Scissors (RPS) dataset.

The objective is to progressively design, train, and evaluate increasingly complex architectures in order to analyze:

- the impact of architectural depth,
- the role of hyperparameter tuning strategies,
- the effect of regularization mechanisms,
- and the trade-off between predictive performance and computational cost.

Three models are developed and compared, following a structured experimental progression from a simple baseline to a deeper architecture optimized through stochastic search.

##  Model Overview

###  Model A — Baseline CNN

A shallow convolutional architecture designed as a reference model.

- Two convolutional blocks  
- Standard ReLU activations and max pooling  
- Single dense classification head  
- Fixed training configuration  

Provides stable convergence and strong baseline performance.

---

###  Model B — Tuned CNN (Grid Search)

Extends the baseline architecture by introducing controlled hyperparameter tuning.

- Variable number of convolutional blocks  
- Variable base number of filters  
- Learning rate selection via grid search  
- Early stopping for regularization  

Designed to evaluate how moderate increases in depth and capacity affect performance.

---

###  Model C — Random-Search CNN

The most flexible and regularized architecture in the project.

Introduces:

- Deeper convolutional backbone  
- Batch Normalization  
- SpatialDropout2D  
- Dropout in the classification head  
- Optional L2 regularization  
- He normal initialization  
- Log-uniform learning rate sampling  
- ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling  

Hyperparameters are selected through random search across a mixed discrete–continuous space.

This model achieves the highest predictive performance while increasing computational complexity.

The project emphasizes systematic experimentation, structured model comparison, and transparent evaluation across progressively refined CNN architectures.
